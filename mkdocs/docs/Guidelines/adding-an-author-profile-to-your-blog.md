Did you know we also write blogs? Our team is passionate about creating content that inspires others to learn and grow. If you share this passion, weâ€™d love to have you join us.

As an author, your hard work deserves recognition. This article will guide you on how to tag yourself as the author of a blog, ensuring you get the credit you deserve.

## Step 1

Open the file located at `docs/blog/.authors.yml`. You will see that we already have a few authors in there. To join the list, create a new entry.

```yaml
authors:
  HYP3R00T: #Your GitHub Handle
    name: Rajesh Kumar Das # Your display name
    description: Contributor # Describe yourself
    avatar: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78068806?v=4 # Link to your GitHub avatar
    url: https://github.com/HYP3R00T # Link to your GitHub profile
```

_Note: Make sure you indent your entry properly._

## Step 2

Now, it's time to tag yourself as the author of a blog. In the blog post, within the frontmatter, put your name under `authors`.

```yaml
---
authors:
  - HYP3ROOT # Your GitHub Handle
---
# Post Content
```
