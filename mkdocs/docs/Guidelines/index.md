Welcome to our community project! We strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment where everyone can contribute and learn. To ensure we maintain a high standard of collaboration, organization, and best practices, we've created this section of guidelines.

This page serves as a hub for our community standards, offering guidance on everything from making notes and documenting our journey, to maintaining consistency and organization in our work. We believe that clear and thorough documentation is key to our collective success, and these guidelines are here to help us achieve that.

Below, you'll find links to various pages detailing specific guidelines on how to approach different tasks within our project. Let's build something great together!
